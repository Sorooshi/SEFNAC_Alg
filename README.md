# SEFNAC

The source codes, experimental test-beds and, the datasets of our paper titled 
"Community Detection in Feature-Rich Networks Using Data Recovery Approach"
By [Boris Mirkin](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/bmirkin) and, [Soroosh Shalileh](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/316426865)


For more information on how to call our algorithm "SEFNAC" one can 
refer to any the demo jupyter notebooks "clustering_results_Lawyers". 

Also this algorithm can be run through the terminal by calling:
  python SEFNAC.py --Name="name of dataset" --PreProcessing="z-m" --Run=1 


For generating similar synthetic data sets, One should call "synthetic_data_generator.py" as 
it is demonstrated in Jupyter notebook "generate_synthetic_data.ipynb".




Remark 1: I will provide a pip installation of this software.


Remark 2:  I will add this algorithm to CDI Lib.
